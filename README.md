## Package Info

This package is a set of 4 minigames that can be run from the main function or included individually in whatever code you choose.

The following code can be used by replacing the placeholder with the specific game of your choosing. The four functions are run_space_game(), run_count_game(), run_rps_game(), run_tic_tac_toe()

```
from . import space_invaders as spacegame
        spacegame.run_space_game()
```

Otherwise, the game hub can be run from the command line by running the __main__.py file.
